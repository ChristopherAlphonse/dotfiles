#### **Title: PRD Generation**

**User Story:** *As a developer, I want to provide a high-level feature idea and receive a structured, unambiguous PRD so that a junior developer can implement it with minimal oversight.*

---

#### **Layer 1: User Journey (Flowchart)**


---

#### **Layer 2: Component Architecture**



| Component | Logic Source | Responsibility | Key Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User Interface** | System Prompt | Capture intent and selections | `Prompt Entry` |
| **Clarification Processor** | `Rule: Process` | Generate lettered/numbered questions | `PRD Mode: Step 2` |
| **Generation Engine** | `Rule: Structure` | Format data into standard PRD sections | `PRD Structure` |
| **Storage Manager** | `Rule: Output` | Write Markdown to specific directory | `/tasks/prd-*.md` |

#### **Layer 3: Sequence Diagram**



**Key Design Patterns Used:**

1. **Stateful Interaction:** The system pauses for user feedback (Clarification Step) before proceeding to final generation, ensuring accuracy.
2. **Template Method:** The PRD follows a rigid, predefined structure regardless of the feature content to ensure consistency.
3. **Persistence Ignorance:** The logic focuses on document structure, while the storage rule dictates the final file path and naming convention.

#### **Data Structures**

#### **Quick Reference**

* **Event Triggers:** User prompt containing "new feature" or "PRD".
* **File Format:** Standard GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown).
* **Error Handling:** If requirements are ambiguous, the AI **must** re-trigger the clarification loop.
* **Validation:** Final PRD must be legible by a "Junior Developer" profile.

#### **Related Lifecycles**

1. **Task Decomposition:** Converting a PRD into a `tasks-prd-*.md` file.
2. **DAP Implementation:** Creating a Deployment Action Plan for schema changes.
3. **System Onboarding:** Generating `use_cases.md` from repo analysis.

**Next Step:** I can now save this lifecycle trace to `/memory/system/001_lifecycle_prd_generation.md`. Would you like me to finalize the file creation?
